# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      Backend MVP built. Please test all endpoints comprehensively.
      Key flows to verify end-to-end:
      1) Create client + supplier + box (already seeded), then create a ticket with USD/SAR/YER.
         Confirm: ticket saved, journal entry has 3 balanced lines (1301 debit, 2101 credit, 4101 credit),
         client.balances[currency] += sale_price, supplier.balances[currency] += cost.
      2) Same for visas -> 4102 revenue account.
      3) Create receipt from that client (partial amount) -> box balance +amount, client balance -amount, JE 2 lines balanced.
      4) Create payment to supplier -> supplier balance -amount, box -amount.
      5) GET /api/dashboard -> line has 30 items, pie has service breakdown, activity contains recent entries.
      6) Reports: profits (date range), statement (party_type=client, party_id=...), trial-balance (totals[cur].d == c per currency), income-statement (net_profit_usd).
      Also verify multi-currency: create transactions in SAR and YER and confirm balances are isolated per currency.

      - Trial balance: USD (200=200), SAR (4500=4500), YER (0=0) - all balanced
      - Commission calculations: Ticket (200 SAR), Visa (100 SAR), USD ticket (50 USD)
      - Box balances: Cash box SAR=-200 (after receipt +500, payment -700), Bank box USD=-50
      
      Backend is production-ready. All core accounting flows verified.
