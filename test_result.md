# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      MAJOR UPDATE — v2.0 SaaS: Added Multi-Tenant architecture + Auth + Super Admin + White-Label + Bulk Excel/CSV import.
      Please re-test the backend end-to-end with the new authentication & tenant scoping.

      - Two seeded accounts:
        * Super Admin: admin@targetmedia.com / Target@2025
        * Demo Tenant Owner: owner@demo.com / Demo@2025

      TEST FLOWS:
      1) POST /api/auth/login as super admin -> get cookie -> GET /api/auth/me should return role=super_admin
      2) POST /api/admin/tenants (as super admin) with { name, owner_email, owner_password, max_users:2 } -> creates tenant + owner user + seeds accounts/boxes
      3) PATCH /api/admin/tenants/:id { status:"suspended" } -> then attempt login as that tenant's owner -> should fail 403
      4) Re-activate. Login as owner@demo.com -> auth/me returns role=owner + tenant + settings
      5) Tenant isolation: create client under demo, then create another tenant + login there, verify GET /api/clients returns only that tenant's data.
      6) POST /api/tickets (tenant scoped) -> auto journal entry works exactly like v1.
      7) POST /api/import/tickets/preview with rows array -> returns validated rows with __errors, __dup, __commission; totals per currency; valid_count.
      8) POST /api/import/tickets to actually insert -> returns { created, skipped, failed }. Also auto-creates missing clients/suppliers by name.
      9) Same for /api/import/visas/preview and /api/import/visas (uses passport_no for dedup).
      10) PUT /api/tenant/settings updates logo_base64, agency_name, tax_id, etc. GET /api/tenant/settings returns them.
      11) POST /api/tenant/users respects max_users limit (should reject after limit reached).
      12) PATCH /api/tenant/users/:id { active:false } -> user can no longer login.
      13) Reports (profits, statement, trial-balance, income-statement) all scoped by tenant.
      14) Role enforcement: as staff user (role='staff') PUT /tenant/settings and POST /tenant/users should return 403.
      15) Error cases: unauthorized (no cookie) -> 401; wrong password -> 401; suspended tenant -> 403.

      Comprehensive test suite executed for v2.1 features (FX account, cash payments, currency exchange, manual journals, enhanced reports):

      1. ✅ FX 4104 Account Seeded
         - Account 4104 'أرباح وخسائر فروق العملات (مصارفة)' exists

         - Supplier balance increases by cost (800 SAR)

         - Supplier balance increases by cost (500 SAR)
         - Journal entry: client debit (1301), supplier credit (2101), revenue credit (4101)
         - Description includes '(آجل)'
         - Default behavior preserved
      
      4. ✅ Visa with cash payment
         - Same pattern as ticket cash payment
         - Box +400, supplier +300, client unchanged
         - Revenue uses account 4102 (visa revenue)
      
      5. ✅ Currency Exchange BUY
         - 100 USD @ 3.75 SAR → counter_amount=375
         - fx_gain_usd=-0.125 (loss calculated correctly)
         - Box1 USD +100, Box2 SAR -375
         - Journal entry: box1 debit 100 USD, box2 credit 375 SAR, FX loss (4104) debit 0.13 USD
      
      6. ✅ Currency Exchange SELL
         - 50 USD @ 3.80 SAR → counter_amount=190
         - fx_gain_usd=0.73 (profit calculated correctly)
         - Box1 USD -50, Box2 SAR +190
         - Journal entry includes FX gain (4104) credit 0.73 USD
      
      7. ✅ Currency Exchange Validation Errors
         - Same currency both sides: 400 'يجب اختيار عملتين مختلفتين'
         - Amount <= 0: 400 error
         - Invalid type: 400 error
      
      8. ✅ Manual Journal - Single Currency
         - Creates correctly with balanced lines
         - Supplier balance updates correctly (credit increases liability)
         - Unbalanced entries rejected with 'القيد غير متوازن'
      
      9. ✅ Manual Journal - DUAL Currency
         - Creates with 3 lines: USD debit 100, SAR credit 375, FX loss (4104) debit 0.13 USD
         - Response includes fx_diff_usd=-0.125
         - Multi-currency journal entries working correctly
      
      10. ✅ Income Statement includes fx_gain_usd
          - fx_gain_usd field present (sum of 4104 credits - debits)
          - net_profit_usd incorporates fx_gain_usd

          - Multiple currencies (USD, SAR, YER) present
          - Totals per currency provided
          - NOTE: Individual currency totals may appear unbalanced in multi-currency systems with FX transactions. This is EXPECTED behavior because FX gain/loss lines (in USD) balance the multi-currency journal entries. When converted to common base currency, everything balances correctly.
      
      12. ✅ Ticket cash payment missing box_id error
          - Correctly returns 400 'اختر الصندوق/البنك للدفع النقدي'
      
      **CRITICAL VERIFICATIONS:**
      ✅ FX account (4104) seeded for all tenants
      ✅ Cash payment method working for tickets and visas
      ✅ Credit payment method (default) preserved
      ✅ Currency exchange BUY/SELL with FX gain/loss calculation
      ✅ Multi-currency journal entries with FX balancing
      ✅ Manual journals (single and dual currency)
      ✅ Income statement includes FX gain/loss
      ✅ Trial balance supports per-line currency
      ✅ All validation errors working correctly
      
      **ACCOUNTING NOTES:**
      - Multi-currency journal entries (fx_buy, fx_sell, manual_dual) show per-currency imbalances, which is EXPECTED. The FX gain/loss lines (account 4104 in USD) balance the entries when converted to base currency.
      - Supplier balance increases when credited (liability increases = we owe them more). This is correct accounting behavior.
      
      Backend v2.1 is production-ready. All new features verified and working correctly.
