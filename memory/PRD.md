# Rahaal (رحّال) — Multi-Currency Travel Office ERP & SaaS — PRD Summary

## Core Product
Next.js 15 monolith + MongoDB. Arabic RTL ERP for travel offices: tickets, visas, services, packages, accounting (double-entry), multi-tenant SaaS, Meraaj Network B2B marketplace integration (Contract v2, HMAC webhooks, bidirectional sync).

## Architecture Constraints (USER MANDATED)
- NO refactoring/splitting of `/app/app/page.js` or `/app/app/api/[[...path]]/route.js`
- NO database schema renames, NO hard deletes
- Meraaj payload (`meraajContractPayload`) and HMAC signing are FROZEN — do not touch
- Communicate with user in Arabic

## Completed (latest first)
- v3.41: All 43 browser-native `confirm()`/`prompt()` calls replaced with professional in-app `askConfirm()` promise-based dialog (global `ConfirmHost` mounted in App root; supports danger/primary variants, icons, irreversible warning, input/prompt mode with required+textarea). Verified visually (duplicate + archive dialogs).
- v3.40: Hotel nights + city tracking with duration summary
- v3.39: Unified pricing + SearchPick smart dropdowns with inline client/supplier creation
- v3.29–v3.38: Full Meraaj integration (first share REST, HMAC webhooks, Contract v2 payload, bidirectional reflection, lifecycle ID sync)
- Mini CRM, archive panel, production cleanup

## Pending
- Meraaj E2E 15/15 test (blocked on Meraaj team configuring temp secret)
- Package Comparison feature (deferred by user)
